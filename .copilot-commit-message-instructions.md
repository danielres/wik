The first line should be a single line summary. Start with the file(s) name(s) then colon, then describe the change shortly.

For example:
".env.example: update superuser ID description"
instead of:
"docs: update superuser ID description in .env.example"

The second line should be blank.
Start the full summary on the third line as a bullet list, each bullet should be separated by a blank line.

Always try to use the shortest wording possible without sacrificing quality, for example "adds" is better than "introduces".

For example:

```
* Clarifies the purpose of the `SUPERUSER_ID` environment variable.

(blank line)

* Adds a new section to the `.env.example` file to explain the purpose of the `SUPERUSER_ID` environment variable.
