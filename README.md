# Wik

Wik is a collaborative wiki platform built with Elixir and Phoenix, designed to turn Telegram groups into shared knowledge hubs.

By integrating with Telegramâ€™s Bot API, Wik allows group members to seamlessly access and contribute to a private wiki using their existing Telegram accounts, no extra sign-ups required. 

Group membership becomes the key to access: adding a member to the Telegram group automatically grants them access to the wiki, while removing them revokes it.

With Wik, every Telegram group can evolve into a living knowledge base, where information is easy to organize, access, and grow collaboratively.

Wik is perfect for any scenario where a small to medium-sized group needs to collaboratively manage and share knowledge in a structured way, without the friction of setting up a separate platform or managing complex permissions. The seamless Telegram integration makes it ideal for real-time collaboration and easy access.

## Examples of ideal use cases

### Community Knowledge Base

A hobby community (e.g., plant care, gaming) can use Wik to compile guides, FAQs, and shared resources in one place, accessible only to members.

### Study Groups

Students organizing a study group via Telegram can use Wik to compile lecture notes, exam prep materials, and useful links, ensuring that everyone in the group has access to the same resources.

## Why Wik Works Well

âœ… **Simple access control:** Group membership = wiki access. 

âœ… **Easy onboarding:** No need for separate accounts or user management.

âœ… **Low friction:** Accessible directly from Telegram with no additional setup. 

âœ… **Real-time updates:** Information stays current as the group evolves.

## Developer Setup

Wik uses several tools to standardize the development environment. Please ensure you have the following installed:

*   **asdf** â€“ for managing Elixir, Erlang, and other language versions. The required versions are specified in the `.tool-versions` file.

### Getting Started

1.  **Install asdf**  
    Follow the [asdf installation guide](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf) if you havenâ€™t already. Then install the required versions by running:
    
    ```
    asdf install
    ```
    
2.  **Configure direnv**  
    Ensure that asdf-direnv is installed. 
    
    In the project root, youâ€™ll find an `.envrc` file containing:
    
    ```
    dotenv
    ```
    
    Run:
    
    ```
    direnv allow
    ```
    
    This will automatically load your environment variables when you enter the project directory.

3.  **Environment Variables**  
    Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration:
    
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    
    Then fill in your own environment variables in the `.env` file.

4.  **Fetch Dependencies and Setup**  
    Install the dependencies and setup the project by running:
    
    ```
    mix setup
    ```
    
    This command will fetch all dependencies, create and migrate the database, and build the assets.

## Authentication

### Production

*   Wik relies on a **Telegram bot** to authenticate users. In production, the bot acts as a gateway: users logging in through Telegram are verified as members of a specific Telegram group. Only group members gain access to the private space shared among the group.
*   **Important:** Deploying Telegram authentication in production requires that the bot is correctly set up and added to a group. The bot token and other related secrets should be set as environment variables.

### Local Development

*   For local development, fake user logins are provided when you open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). This means you do not need to set up a Telegram bot for everyday testing.
*   If you want to try out real Telegram authentication locally, you can use a tunneling tool such as [zrok](https://zrok.io) to expose your local server to the internet.
*   **Note:** Except when using fake users in development, Telegram login requires the existence of a Telegram bot. Adding the bot to a Telegram group will grant you access to a private space shared among the group members.

## Deployment on Fly.io

1.  **Install flyctl**  
    Install the Fly.io CLI tool by running:
    
    ```
    curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
    ```
    
    Ensure that the `flyctl` binary is in your PATH.
2.  **Configure Secrets**  
    Set the required secrets (e.g. `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `BOT_TOKEN`, etc.) by running:
    
    ```
    flyctl secrets set SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key_here BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
    ```
    
3.  **Deploy**  
    With Fly.io configured (via your `fly.toml` file), deploy your application using:
    
    ```
    flyctl deploy
    ```
    
    For more details, refer to the [Fly.io documentation](https://fly.io/docs/).
